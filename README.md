### Hi there 👋

I'm **Oluwafemi**, a fullstack mobile application 📱 developer writing code with React Native and NodeJS. More of a MERN stack actually (featuring GraphQL😅). Finished two production ready mobile apps 😪:
- 6TQ is a quiz mobile application allowing users to win cash prizes (virtual 🙃) based on the amount they choose to stake with. And yeah, this also comes with dark mode support and ads integration to earn more lives (⚡⚡). [Try it out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t-iUzfOWONnHo4EGGquaF8VC72O8o303/view?usp=sharing)
- A financial investment application built for [@Secure Capital](https://www.securecapitallimited.com), allowing users to create and manage investments instantly and with ease. Patiently awaiting approval 😊⌛

## He loves gaming too!! 😬😬
Okay,  fun fact! My alias (*echoeyecodes*) was actually coined from two words. First is (EchoEye) which is from the game - Tales from the Borderlands😁 and of course.. I Code too!!😊 Yeah, I know! It's one of the best stuff out there. Big fan of the Call of Duty franchise also. I love every single one of them!! Other favorites are Apex legends and Grand Theft Auto😎😎

I'm open to collaborate and network with other developers on projects that gets you* excited. You can always reach out to me and I'll be happy to respond😊

Lastly, I'm currently trying out native Android development with Java [Latest project](https://github.com/echoeyecodes/Sinnerman), hoping to understand the native side of things from an hybrid's perspective.😉 I actually Fell in love with Java's statically typed paradigm which urged me to start implementing typescript for new javascript project.
