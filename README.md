### Hi there 👋

I'm **Oluwafemi**, a fullstack software developer. You should know me by my greatest hits 😊:

- Picashot | Virtual Gaming Photography: An android application built for the virtual gaming photography community to share in-game photos, screenshots, and creative edits captured from definite moments that tells a story based on perspective, or passes across a well-crafted message that expresses a state of mind. [App Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echoeyecodes.picashot)

- Dobby | Social Media Downloader: Dobby is a fast, easy, and secure app to download videos, images, Reels, IGTV and other media files from Twitter and Instagram. Download any of your favorite media files from these sites in HD and share them directly to other applications. [App Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echoeyecodes.dobby)

- ClipClip: See this app as a sequel to Dobby😉. With this app, you can trim your videos into multiple parts with multiple time interval between them. Mostly useful for when you've got a video clip to share on WhatsApp/Instagram and you need to split them into parts to match the max time limit for videos allowed on WhatsApp or Instagram [App Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echoeyecodes.clipclip)


## Sucker for video games!! 😬😬
Okay,  fun fact! My alias (*echoeyecodes*) was actually coined from two words. First is (EchoEye) which is from the game - Tales from the Borderlands😁 and of course.. I Code too!!😊 Yeah, I know! It's one of the best stuff out there. Big fan of the Call of Duty franchise also. I love every single one of them!! Other favorites are Apex legends and Grand Theft Auto😎😎

I'm open to collaborate and network with other developers on projects that gets you* excited. You can always reach out to me and I'll be happy to respond😊
