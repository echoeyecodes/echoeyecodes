### Hi there 👋

I'm **Oluwafemi**, a fullstack mobile application 📱 developer, previously with React Native, but now settling fulltime with Kotlin for android development. You should know me by my greatest hits 😊:
- Sinnerman: My first native android application. Started with Java before porting over to Kotlin. Sinnerman is a video streaming application built primarily for my favorite games... Topping this list is [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends) so you would see more that 😊

- 6TQ is a quiz mobile application allowing users to win cash prizes (virtual 🙃) based on the amount they choose to stake with. And yeah, this also comes with dark mode support and ads integration to earn more lives (⚡⚡). [Try it out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t-iUzfOWONnHo4EGGquaF8VC72O8o303/view?usp=sharing)

- A financial investment application built for [@Secure Capital](https://www.securecapitallimited.com), allowing users to create and manage investments instantly and with ease. Here's a [working demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sk15juw9Zffwy0aDlSByeioP-ZwEwF4s/view?usp=drivesdk)⏳

## Sucker for video games!! 😬😬
Okay,  fun fact! My alias (*echoeyecodes*) was actually coined from two words. First is (EchoEye) which is from the game - Tales from the Borderlands😁 and of course.. I Code too!!😊 Yeah, I know! It's one of the best stuff out there. Big fan of the Call of Duty franchise also. I love every single one of them!! Other favorites are Apex legends and Grand Theft Auto😎😎

I'm open to collaborate and network with other developers on projects that gets you* excited. You can always reach out to me and I'll be happy to respond😊
